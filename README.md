# Building RDF data type Neural Nets

  You might be thinking why use RDF for creating and storing neural networks. The goal of this applications are not neccessarily 
  suggesting a better way of representing neural nets than other but to show what can one achieve using graph based data structures
  such as RDF to create a neural net. Examples will be in public repositories of Dydra.com, and I will be sharing the link here.
